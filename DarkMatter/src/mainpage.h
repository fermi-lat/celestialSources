 /*! \mainpage DarkMatter Package:  A repository for dark matter simulated spetra
   
 The DarkMatter package is a simple repository of text files representing the spectrum 
 resulting from a simulation of sark matter annihilation, based on DarkSusy or any other software. 
 As of now, the only requirement is that the format be in 2 columns: one for the energy bin, 
 and the other for the differential flux> The latter does not need to be normalized. The total flux can 
 indeed be set from the xml definition  of the source.

 This package is thus not intended to contain any 'code': the source is created from the file by 
 an instance of the FILESpectrum class (to be found in the flux package.)
