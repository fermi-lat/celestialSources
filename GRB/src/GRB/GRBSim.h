  \class GRBSim
  \brief Simulator engine of a GRB source.
  
  This class initializes the simulation generating shells with random 
  Lorentz factors and stacks the shells in a vector.
  The evolution with the time is evaluated for all the shells and when two 
  shells have the same radius they collide, and a GRBShock is created. 
  All the shocks are staked in a vector. For each shock is evaluated the 
  observed time at which it occurs.
  This time is used to sort the vector. GRBsim compute the spectrum at a 
  given time and returns it in a vector. 
  This class returns the energy of a photon (chosen from the spectrum), 
  the flux and the rate.
