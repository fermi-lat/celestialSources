/*!
 * \class GRBSim
 * \brief Simulator engine of a GRB source.
 *
 * This class initializes the simulation generating shells with random Lorentz factor and stacks the shells in a vector.
 * The evolution with the time is evaluated for all the shells and with two shells have the same radius they collide, and a GRBShock is created. 
 * All the shocks are staked in a vector. For each shock is evaluated the observed time at which it occurs.
 * This time is used to sort the vector. GRBsim compute the spectrum at a given time and returns it in a vector. 
 * This class returns the energy of a photon (chosen from the spectrum), the flux and the rate.
